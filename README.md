# Django - Token Authentication

## Description

This is an example program of how to Authenticate users with token.

## Copying the code
* Open 'serializers.py' inside 'api' folder and copy the content into your app's serializer file.
* The 'views.py' contains the API view of the login and signup functions with token authentication. Copy them into your app's views file.
* Copying the url is not necessary but the url for signup and login API is inside the 'urls.py' file.

## Test the code
* Open your localhost, default : http://127.0.0.1:8000/
* Navigate to the login/signup view using the urls provided in 'urls.py'.
* The API can be viewed in the browser and Signup/Login can be done in the browser.
* Though both APIs can be viewed in the browser, it is recommended to use any API testing software like postman.
